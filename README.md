# Hospital Location Optimization Project

## Overview

This project was a task done in PUT Labs, focusing on optimizing the placement of hospitals in a grid-based space to minimize the sum of Manhattan distances from houses to the nearest hospital. The project involves implementing a hill-climbing algorithm to find the optimal hospital locations and visualizing the optimization path on a heatmap.

## Features

### Hill-Climbing Algorithm

*Description*: The hill-climbing algorithm iteratively improves the hospital placement by moving hospitals to better locations, reducing the total distance from houses to hospitals.

### Heatmap Visualization

</div>

*Description*: The heatmap is generated and visualization done using Matplotlib and it shows the Manhattan distances from houses to potential hospital locations.
